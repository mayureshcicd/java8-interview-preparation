The Interface who contains only one abstract method but can have multiple default and 
static method is called functional interface. 
It can contain any number of Object class methods.  

Example of functional Interface in JAVA:-->

Runnable 	-----------------> run()
Callable 	-----------------> call()
Comparable  -----------------> compareTo()
Comparator  -----------------> compare()   

Runnable , Callable, Comparable and Comparator , these 4 are functional interface.
These functional interface contains only 1 method.
Runnable 	functional interface contains only 1 method	-----------------> run() 
Callable 	functional interface contains only 1 method	-----------------> call()
Comparable 	functional interface contains only 1 method -----------------> compareTo()
Comparator 	functional interface contains only 1 method -----------------> compare() 



What is difference between normal interface and functional interface?
Java interface can have any number of abstract methods however functional interface must 
have only one abstract method.

Why do we use functional interface?
A functional interface is an interface that contains only a single abstract method 
(a method that doesn't have a body). The main reason why we need functional interfaces 
is that we can use them in a lambda expression and method references.

Functional Interfaces Can Be Implemented by a Lambda Expression.

The Java Function interface (java.util.function.Function) interface. 
The Function interface represents a function (method) that takes a single parameter 
and returns a single value.
